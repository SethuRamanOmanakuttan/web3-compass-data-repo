<h2>The Evolution of the Internet: From Web 1.0 to Web3</h2>
<p>
  In the world of the internet, much like fashion trends or the seasons, things
  change—sometimes drastically, and sometimes, we barely notice. The internet we
  know today didn’t just pop up fully formed; it evolved through different
  versions, each with its own quirks and capabilities. So buckle up as we
  journey through Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web3, and we’ll even clear up that tiny
  (but important) confusion between Web3 and Web 3.0.

<h3>Web 1.0: The Static Age</h3>
<p>
  Ah, Web 1.0—the OG internet. Picture this: it’s the early 90s, and websites
  look more like digital brochures than the interactive wonderlands we’re used
  to today. If you were online, you were probably using dial-up (cue the
  screechy modem sounds), and your browsing experience was more like reading a
  digital magazine. It was all about consuming information.
</p>

<h4>What Defined Web 1.0?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Static Pages:</strong> The websites didn’t change unless someone
    manually updated them. There were no user-generated comments, no social
    feeds, and definitely no cat memes. Just you and a page of text.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Read-Only:</strong> Interaction? Never heard of it. If you wanted to
    post something online, you'd need to be a tech wizard. The average user
    could only browse, scroll, and maybe click on a link or two.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Centralized Content Creation:</strong> If you weren’t a developer or
    part of a big organization, you probably weren’t creating content. Web 1.0
    was very much a one-way street—information flowed from a few creators to the
    masses.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Think of Web 1.0 as the encyclopedia era of the internet. A place to gather
  information, but no space for conversations or user engagement.
</p>

<h3>Web 2.0: The Social (and Centralized) Explosion</h3>
<p>
  By the mid-2000s, the internet had gone through its awkward teenage years and
  was now entering its social butterfly phase. Web 2.0 wasn’t just about
  passively consuming content—it was about interacting, sharing, and, well, cat
  memes. It was the birth of social media, blogs, and the ability to leave
  reviews on products you’ve never bought.
</p>

<h4>What Defined Web 2.0?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> Pages could now change on the fly. Think
    of refreshing your Facebook feed or watching videos recommended based on
    your history. The internet became personalized.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Suddenly, everyone was a creator.
    You could post pictures, write blogs, upload videos, and comment on
    anything. The web was no longer a one-way street but a bustling
    conversation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Rise of Platforms:</strong> The Facebooks, Googles, and Amazons
    of the world took over. They created massive platforms where users could
    congregate, but here’s the kicker—they owned everything. Your posts, photos,
    and videos all sat on their servers. These companies became the gatekeepers
    of the internet.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  While Web 2.0 democratized content creation, it also centralized control. Big
  tech companies became the middlemen, storing, managing, and often monetizing
  user data. Sure, you got to connect with friends, but it came at the cost of
  your privacy, with data being sold to advertisers in the background.
</p>

<h3>Web 3.0 (Tim Berners-Lee’s Vision)</h3>
<p>
  Now, before we jump into Web3, let’s clear up a little confusion. Web 3.0 and
  Web3 are not the same thing. Web 3.0 was a term coined by Tim Berners-Lee, the
  guy who invented the World Wide Web (so, yeah, his opinions are kind of
  important).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Web 3.0</strong> (according to Berners-Lee) is all about the
  <strong>Semantic Web</strong>—a smarter, more intelligent web that understands
  not just the words on a page, but the meaning behind them. It’s like teaching
  the internet to connect the dots for us.
</p>

<h4>What Defined Web 3.0 (Semantic Web)?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Contextual Understanding:</strong> In Web 3.0, the internet wouldn’t
    just show you websites based on a search term—it would understand the
    relationships between data. It would know that if you searched for "Apple,"
    you might mean the fruit, the company, or even the record label, and it
    could figure that out based on your past searches and habits.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>AI-Driven:</strong> Artificial intelligence would play a huge role
    in curating, personalizing, and automating our digital experiences. The web
    would become smarter, helping us sift through the noise.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, while Web 3.0 was all about making the internet more intelligent and
  helpful, it didn’t address the centralization problem. Big companies were
  still the ones in control of our data.
</p>

<h3>Web3: The Decentralized Future</h3>
<p>
  Enter <strong>Web3</strong>, the version of the internet that’s about taking
  power back from corporations and putting it in the hands of the users. Imagine
  an internet where no single company owns your data, where your online identity
  isn’t tied to a specific platform, and where you control who has access to
  your information. That’s the vision behind Web3.
</p>

<h4>What Defines Web3?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Decentralization:</strong> At its core, Web3 is about removing the
    middlemen (goodbye, Big Tech!). Instead of your data being stored on a
    company’s server, it’s stored across a decentralized network. Think of
    blockchain as the backbone of this new internet.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Ownership of Data:</strong> You own your data—whether it’s your
    social media posts, your digital identity, or even your money in the form of
    cryptocurrency. No one else can take it or use it without your permission.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies:</strong> Web3 runs on blockchain
    technology. Blockchain allows for secure, transparent, and immutable
    records, which makes it perfect for decentralized applications (dApps).
    Cryptocurrencies are the native currencies of Web3, allowing people to
    transact without intermediaries like banks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Web2 vs. Web3: The Big Differences</h3>
<p>
  In <strong>Web2</strong>, the platforms (think Google, Facebook, Amazon) own
  everything. They make the rules, store your data, and often profit from it. In
  <strong>Web3</strong>, you’re the one in control. Decentralized applications
  (dApps) run on blockchain networks, meaning no single entity controls the
  application or the data within it.
</p>
<p>
  Where Web2 was all about participation (liking, commenting, posting), Web3 is
  about <strong>ownership</strong> and <strong>control</strong>.
</p>

<h3>So… Web3 or Web 3.0?</h3>
<p>
  Web 3.0 (the Semantic Web) is about making the internet smarter and more
  intuitive. Web3, on the other hand, is about decentralization and giving power
  back to the users. While Web 3.0 focuses on the intelligence of the internet,
  Web3 is focused on the infrastructure, ensuring that the internet is more
  user-controlled, secure, and private.
</p>

<h3>Why Does Web3 Matter?</h3>
<p>
  Think about the current state of the web—data breaches, invasive ads, and
  censorship are all too common. Web3 promises an internet where these issues
  are addressed at the core. Since no single entity controls the network, it’s
  more secure and resilient. And because users control their data, privacy is
  baked into the system.
</p>

<h3>Wrapping It Up: The Internet's Evolution</h3>
<p>
  From the static, read-only world of <strong>Web 1.0</strong>, to the
  interactive but centralized realm of <strong>Web 2.0</strong>, we’re now on
  the cusp of a more user-owned internet with <strong>Web3</strong>. While Web
  3.0 sought to make the web smarter, Web3 is here to make it fairer and more
  secure. The future of the internet isn’t just about reading or writing—it’s
  about owning. And with Web3, we’re taking back the keys to our digital lives.
