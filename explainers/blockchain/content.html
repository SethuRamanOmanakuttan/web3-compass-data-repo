<h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
<p>
  A blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions or
  data across a network of computers. It's the underlying technology behind
  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its potential applications
  extend far beyond digital currencies.
</p>

<h3>Key Features of Blockchain</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Decentralization:</strong> No single entity controls the network,
    making it resistant to censorship and manipulation.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are visible to network
    participants, fostering trust and accountability.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once data is added to the blockchain, it
    cannot be altered or deleted, ensuring data integrity.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Security:</strong> Cryptographic techniques secure the network and
    protect against unauthorized access.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How Blockchain Works</h3>
<p>
  Blockchain operates by grouping transactions into blocks, which are then
  linked together using cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a reference to
  the previous block, creating a chain of blocks. This chain structure makes it
  extremely difficult to alter any past transactions, as it would require
  modifying all subsequent blocks.
</p>

<h3>Applications of Blockchain</h3>
<p>
  Blockchain has a wide range of potential applications beyond cryptocurrencies,
  including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supply chain management</li>
  <li>Healthcare records</li>
  <li>Identity verification</li>
  <li>Voting systems</li>
  <li>Smart contracts</li>
  <li>Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges and Considerations</h3>
<p>While blockchain offers many benefits, it also comes with challenges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Scalability: Processing large volumes of transactions can be slow and
    energy-intensive.
  </li>
  <li>
    Regulation: The legal and regulatory framework surrounding blockchain is
    still evolving.
  </li>
  <li>
    Complexity: Understanding and implementing blockchain technology can be
    challenging.
  </li>
  <li>
    Energy Consumption: Some blockchain networks, particularly those using
    Proof-of-Work consensus, consume significant amounts of energy.
  </li>
</ul>
