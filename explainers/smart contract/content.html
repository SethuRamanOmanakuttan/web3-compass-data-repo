<h2>What are Smart Contracts?</h2>
<p>
  Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement
  directly written into code. They run on blockchain networks, primarily
  Ethereum, and automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met.
</p>

<h3>Key Features of Smart Contracts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> Once deployed, they operate independently.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Transparency:</strong> All parties can see the contract's terms.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Speed and Efficiency:</strong> Automate processes and remove
    intermediaries.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accuracy:</strong> Reduce manual errors in contract execution.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>How Smart Contracts Work</h3>
<p>
  Smart contracts are typically written in a blockchain-specific programming
  language, such as Solidity for Ethereum. When deployed, they reside at a
  specific address on the blockchain. Users can then interact with the smart
  contract by sending transactions to this address, which trigger the execution
  of the contract's functions.
</p>

<h3>Applications of Smart Contracts</h3>
<p>Smart contracts have a wide range of potential applications, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols</li>
  <li>Supply chain management</li>
  <li>Insurance claim processing</li>
  <li>Voting systems</li>
  <li>Real estate transactions</li>
  <li>Intellectual property rights management</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges and Considerations</h3>
<p>
  While smart contracts offer many benefits, they also come with challenges:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code vulnerabilities can lead to exploits and losses</li>
  <li>Lack of flexibility once deployed</li>
  <li>Legal status is still evolving in many jurisdictions</li>
  <li>Potential for unintended consequences due to code complexity</li>
</ul>
